# endpoints

[Google Endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints')

This library helps you to correctly initialize Google Client library to be used
from AngularJS. Once your endpoints correctly initialized, you can inject them in your different AngularJS's components (i.e. controller)

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
